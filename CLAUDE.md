# CLAUDE.md — agent guide for this repository

You are working in a reference directory on Brazilian legal and
political institutions. This file is the entry point for Claude Code
and similar agents. **Read this once at session start; then grep the
indices below before reading topical files.**

## What this is and isn't

- **Is**: a topical reference compiled for empirical research on
  Brazilian institutions. Courts, procedure, MP, fiscal federalism,
  elections, procurement, corruption statutes. Notes are dense enough
  to inform research design but not exhaustive.
- **Is not**: an authoritative legal treatise, current binding law,
  or a substitute for reading the statute. Most claims cite a statute
  or jurisprudence inline; verify against the primary source for
  legally-current work.

## How to navigate

**Always start with the indices**, not the topical files. The
indices are designed to surface the right topical file in one grep:

| Index | When to use |
|---|---|
| [`siglas.md`](siglas.md) | You hit an unfamiliar acronym (CGU, MPF, FPM, NTEP, FEFC, RGPS, etc.) — get full name + one-line function + pointer to the topical file |
| [`glossario.md`](glossario.md) | You hit a Portuguese legal term you might be misreading (*acórdão*, *súmula vinculante*, *prevenção*, *parecer prévio*, *contas de governo* vs *gestão*) |
| [`leis_index.yaml`](leis_index.yaml) | You need metadata about a specific law (status: vigente / parcialmente revogada / revogada; key articles; topics; files where discussed). Bridges to article-level law databases when available. |
| [`jurisprudencia-stf.md`](jurisprudencia-stf.md) | You need the canonical description of an STF case (Tema 157, Tema 1199, ADI 4650, ADI 5766, ADPF 982, HC 126.292, etc.) — described once here, cross-referenced from topical files |
| [`jurisprudencia_index.yaml`](jurisprudencia_index.yaml) | You need structured metadata about a case: status (vigente / superada / parcialmente_superada / modulada), supersession chain, theme, files where discussed. Resolvable via ``Tema1199``-style citations through `cite.py`. |
| [`sumulas_vinculantes.yaml`](sumulas_vinculantes.yaml) | You need the verbatim text of an STF Súmula Vinculante (all 63, scraped from the STF portal). Resolvable via ``SV14``-style citations through `cite.py`. |
| [`README.md`](README.md) | The full topical file index, organized by section |

After consulting an index, **read the relevant topical file** for the
substantive answer.

## Grep conventions

Files are designed for grep-first reading. Useful patterns:

- **Statute citations**: search `Lei \d+/\d+` (e.g., `Lei 8.666/93`),
  `LC \d+`, `CF Art\. \d+`, `STF Tema \d+`, `ADI \d+`, `HC \d+`. These
  appear inline at the point of assertion.
- **Acronyms**: most appear in `siglas.md` first; topical files
  define acronyms on first use, then use the bare acronym thereafter.
- **Topic keywords**: each topical file has a `Topics / keywords` line
  near the top with both Portuguese and English terms. Search
  bilingually — "bid rigging" won't hit, but `cartel` and `licitação`
  will.
- **Snapshot dates**: each topical file has a `Snapshot as of YYYY`
  note. Time-volatile claims (monetary thresholds, lists of
  municipalities, current officeholders) are flagged with "as of YYYY"
  inline. Treat anything without a date as durable; treat anything
  with a date as needing verification before being cited as current.

## Citing statutes — the canonical compact form

This repository uses a canonical citation format that is designed to
**resolve directly against an article-level law database** under
`tools/leis_artigos/` (database file shipped separately). Following
the format consistently is the contract between the prose reference
and the lookup tool.

The format is intentionally compact: most citations are 5–15
characters between the backticks.

### Form

Citations are wrapped in single backticks so they render as inline
code (monospace) on github.com and remain a single, distinctive
greppable token:

```
`<identifier>.<artigo>[-<letra>][.<path>][<modifier>]`
```

- **Single backticks** wrap every resolvable citation. The contract
  for the resolver is "inline-code spans whose contents start with a
  known apelido or fonte_id"; non-citation inline code (file paths,
  function names, ordinary technical strings) is silently ignored
  by the parser. The apelido catalog in `leis_index.yaml` is the
  source of truth for what counts as a citation.
- **Dot is the universal separator** between identifier, article,
  and path. The hyphen is reserved for article letters
  (e.g., `17-A`), so paths and article letters never collide.
- **Most parts are optional** — citing just the law (`LIA`) or
  just the article (`LIA.9`) is valid.

### Identifier

- **Cataloged laws** use the apelido from `leis_index.yaml`. Currently
  cataloged: `LIA` (Lei 8.429/1992), `L8666` (Lei 8.666/1993),
  `L14133` (Lei 14.133/2021), `LE` (Lei 9.504/1997). New apelidos are
  added as the database grows.
- **Non-cataloged laws** use the canonical fonte_id form from the
  database: `L<numero>-<ano>` for leis (`L13709-2018`),
  `LC<numero>-<ano>` for leis complementares (`LC64-1990`),
  `EC<numero>-<ano>` for emendas constitucionais (`EC97-2017`),
  `DL<numero>-<ano>` for decretos-lei (`DL2848-1940`).
- **Conventional abbreviations** for codes and the constitution:
  `CF`, `CP`, `CPP`, `CLT`, `CTN`. These are not cataloged as
  separate fonte_ids but follow the same syntax.

### Article and path

- `<artigo>` is the article number. Plain integer (`9`, `145`).
- `<letra>` (optional) is an article letter, separated by hyphen
  (`17-A`, `21-B`).
- `<path>` (optional) follows the structural-path convention used by
  the database: `caput`, `II`, `II.a`, `§1`, `§1.II`, `§1.II.a`,
  `§unico`, `ementa`. See `tools/leis_artigos/PATH_CONVENTION.md`
  for the full grammar once the tool is in place.
- The article and path are separated by a dot, as is anything inside
  the path.

### Vintage modifiers (optional)

| Modifier | Meaning | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| (none) | Currently in force | `vigente_ate IS NULL` |
| `@YYYY-MM-DD` | Version in force on this date | `vigente_desde <= date AND (vigente_ate IS NULL OR date < vigente_ate)` |
| ` from:fonte_id` | Version introduced by a specific source | `fonte_id = X` |
| `:original` | The first-published version | min(`vigente_desde`) for that path |
| `:current` | Explicit "currently in force" (same as no modifier) | `vigente_ate IS NULL` |

The `@date` and `:original`/`:current` modifiers are appended directly
with no space. The `from:` modifier requires a leading space because
the source identifier itself contains a hyphen.

### Examples

```
`LIA.9`                          ← whole article, all current paths
`LIA.9.§1.II`                    ← specific leaf, current
`LIA.17-A`                       ← article with letter
`LIA.17-A.caput`                 ← caput of Art. 17-A
`LIA.17-A.§1.II.a`               ← alínea a of inciso II of § 1 of Art. 17-A
`LE.28.§1`                       ← § 1 of Art. 28 of Lei das Eleições
`LE.11.§10@2024-12-31`           ← § 10 before LC 219/2025 revoked it
`L14133.75.II`                   ← inciso II of Art. 75 of Nova Lei de Licitações
`L13709-2018.7`                  ← Art. 7 of Lei 13.709/2018 (LGPD; non-cataloged)
`LI.1.I.g`                       ← Lei das Inelegibilidades Art. 1 I g (Ficha Limpa contas)
`CF.31.§2`                       ← Constituição Art. 31 § 2
`CP.312`                         ← Código Penal Art. 312
`LIA.11.§unico@2020-06-01`       ← what § único said in mid-2020
`LIA.10 from:L14230-2021`        ← Art. 10 as rewritten by the 2021 reform
`LIA.10:original`                ← original 1992 wording of Art. 10
`LIA.ementa`                     ← the law's preamble
`LIA`                            ← refer to the law as a whole
`L14230-2021`                    ← refer to a non-cataloged amending law as an entity
```

### Citing amendment events

The database has a separate `amendment` table for tracking which
amending lei touched which clause, but **citations don't need a
separate amendment-event syntax**. Express the change as a combination
of leaf citations + amending-law citations:

> The 2021 reform `L14230-2021` rewrote `LIA.10` and eliminated
> culposa improbidade. Pre-reform, `LIA.10:original` permitted both
> intentional and negligent conduct; post-reform,
> `LIA.10 from:L14230-2021` requires proof of dolo.

When you need to query the amendment table directly (e.g., "what did
L14230-2021 touch?"), use the lookup tool with `--by-amending`
flag — but the prose stays in leaf-citation form.

### When to use the backtick form vs prose mention

- **Use the backtick form** when you want a *resolvable* citation —
  one that points to a specific row (or query) in the database. This
  is most useful when discussing a specific clause's text, comparing
  versions, or anchoring a claim to the precise statutory language.
- **Use prose mention** ("Lei 8.429/1992 Art. 9", "the 2021 reform")
  for narrative references that don't need to resolve to a specific
  database row.
- **Both styles can coexist in the same paragraph.** The backtick form
  is opt-in; existing topical files mostly use prose mentions and
  that's fine.

### Migration policy

- Don't sweep existing files to convert prose mentions to backtick
  form. That's high-effort and low-value.
- When you *touch* a topical file for other reasons, you may
  opportunistically convert the most prominent statutory anchors to
  backtick form — particularly for the four cataloged laws.
- When a new law gets cataloged, its apelido is added to
  `leis_index.yaml` and topical files can reference it with the new
  apelido.

### Apelido naming policy

- Apelidos are short, distinct, and assigned in `leis_index.yaml`.
- For most ordinary leis, the apelido is `L<numero>` (e.g., `L8666`,
  `L14133`).
- For laws with a widely-known acronym, the acronym is preferred
  (e.g., `LIA` for Lei de Improbidade Administrativa, `LE` for Lei
  Eleitoral, `LRF` for Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal, `LAI`,
  `LGPD`).
- For ambiguity (`CC` could be Código Civil 2002 or Código Comercial
  1850), the first cataloged law gets the apelido and conflicts are
  resolved with a year suffix (`CC2002`, `CC1850`).

## Citing jurisprudência — backtick form for cases

The same backtick grammar also accepts STF (and selected STJ) case
identifiers. These resolve against
[`jurisprudencia_index.yaml`](jurisprudencia_index.yaml) via the same
`cite.py` tool used for statutes.

### Form

```
`<case-id>`
```

`<case-id>` is the case's classe prefix concatenated with its number,
no spaces, no dots:

```
`Tema1199`      ← repercussão geral Tema 1199
`Tema157`       ← repercussão geral Tema 157
`ADI4650`       ← ADI 4650
`ADC43`         ← ADC 43 (compound — also covers ADC 44 and 54 via aliases)
`ADPF982`       ← ADPF 982
`HC126292`      ← HC 126.292
`ARE652777`     ← ARE 652.777
`ARE843989`     ← alias for Tema 1199; resolves to the same entry
```

Recognized prefixes: `Tema`, `ADI`, `ADC`, `ADPF`, `ADO`, `RE`, `ARE`,
`AI`, `HC`, `RHC`, `MS`, `RMS`, `MI`, `MC`, `Rcl`, `Pet`, `Inq`, `AP`,
`AR`, `ACO`. A second pattern accepts compound named keys ending in a
4-digit year (e.g., `LulaMoro2021`) for joint-trial entries that don't
fit the prefix grammar.

### What lookup returns

Each entry in the YAML index carries:

- **id, tipo, processo / processos, aliases** — identification
- **decidido, relator, votacao, tese_certificada** — provenance
- **tema, holding_short** — what the case is about
- **status** — `vigente`, `superada`, `parcialmente_superada`,
  `modulada`. Always check this before relying on a case as good law.
- **supera, superado_por, complementa, complementado_por** —
  supersession and complementarity chains. Lets you trace whether a
  citation has been overruled (e.g., `HC126292` has
  `superado_por: ADC43`).
- **discussed_in, related_leis** — cross-references to topical files
  and to `leis_index.yaml` apelidos.
- **fonte** — link to the STF portal or other authoritative source.

### When to use backtick form vs prose mention

Same policy as for statute citations:

- **Use the backtick form** when you want a *resolvable* citation —
  one that points to a structured entry, particularly when you want to
  signal "still good law" or anchor a claim to the canonical case.
- **Use prose mention** ("Tema 1199", "the 2019 reversal of execução
  provisória") for narrative references.
- **The substantive prose description stays in
  `jurisprudencia-stf.md`.** The YAML index is metadata, not a
  duplicate of the case description.

## Citing Súmulas Vinculantes — backtick form for SVs

The backtick grammar also accepts STF Súmulas Vinculantes by number,
resolved against [`sumulas_vinculantes.yaml`](sumulas_vinculantes.yaml)
through `cite.py`. The YAML stores the **verbatim enunciado** as
published by STF, so a lookup returns the exact text — no
paraphrasing, no transcription risk.

### Form

```
`SV<number>`
```

```
`SV14`    ← acesso amplo da defesa aos elementos de prova
`SV13`    ← nepotismo
`SV37`    ← atualização monetária / honorários
`SV47`    ← natureza alimentar dos honorários
`SV9`     ← (cancelada — verifique status antes de citar)
```

### What lookup returns

- **numero** — the SV number
- **enunciado** — the verbatim text as published by STF
- **status** — `vigente`, `cancelada`, or `revogada`
- **fonte** — canonical STF portal URL
- **publicacao** — DOU/DJE date (currently null for most entries; not
  auto-extracted from the STF portal — fill by hand when known)

### Coverage and policy

- All **63** STF Súmulas Vinculantes are present (the closed set as
  of the 2026-04-09 scrape). SV 9 is the only one currently
  `cancelada`.
- Súmulas vinculantes are a closed, small, high-importance set —
  binding under CF Art. 103-A. Worth bulk collection.
- **Ordinary súmulas (STF, STJ, TST, TSE)** are *not* bulk-collected.
  When a topical file cites one (e.g., Súmula STJ 568), add an entry
  by hand at that point. The reference repo's job is making *cited*
  things resolvable, not mirroring all of Brazilian jurisprudence.
- When STF cancels or revokes a SV, update the YAML entry's `status`
  field and add a `nota` line explaining the change. Do not delete the
  entry — superseded SVs remain citable for historical analysis.

### When to add a new case

When a topical file cites a previously-unseen STF case:

1. Add the substantive description to `jurisprudencia-stf.md` (one
   canonical entry per case).
2. Add a structured entry to `jurisprudencia_index.yaml` keyed by
   the canonical backtick-form id.
3. Set `status` honestly. If the case has been overruled, set
   `status: superada` and fill `superado_por`.
4. Cross-reference both ways: `discussed_in` in the YAML, and a
   `Cited in:` line in `jurisprudencia-stf.md`.

## When you make changes

- **Preserve the conventions**. Each topical file opens with: scope
  paragraph → `Topics / keywords` line → `Snapshot as of YYYY` →
  scope and cross-references → topical content → cross-references at
  bottom.
- **Cite sources inline.** New claims need a statute reference, a
  CNJ/CNMP resolution number, or a published source. Format like
  existing files: `Lei 8.666/93 Art. 23`, `STF Tema 157`, `CNJ Res.
  185/2013`.
- **Update the indices** when you add or remove material:
  - New statute → add to `leis_index.yaml`.
  - New STF case → add to `jurisprudencia-stf.md` (canonical
    description) and reference it from the topical file.
  - New acronym → add to `siglas.md`.
  - New Portuguese legal term that needs disambiguation → add to
    `glossario.md`.
- **Cross-reference both ways.** If you add content to one file that
  relates to another, add a "See also" pointer or inline link in
  both directions.
- **Don't paste verbatim statute text.** Files should be explanatory
  notes and summaries, not statute copies. Link to planalto.gov.br
  for the actual text.
- **Don't add unsourced empirical findings** from in-progress research
  projects, personal communications, or unpublished work. The
  audience is public. If a claim isn't verifiable against a public
  source, leave it out or generalize it.

## Things to avoid

- **Don't invent statute numbers, article numbers, STF case numbers,
  or dates.** If you're not sure, say so or look it up. The whole
  value of this reference depends on its citations being correct.
- **Don't conflate similar terms.** *Súmula* ≠ *súmula vinculante*.
  *Conexão* ≠ *prevenção*. *Impedimento* (objective, ex officio) ≠
  *suspeição* (subjective, party-raised). *Contas de governo* (TCE
  parecer + câmara vote) ≠ *contas de gestão* (TCE direct judgment).
  When in doubt, check `glossario.md`.
- **Don't extrapolate from one branch to another.** Procedural rules,
  case-assignment mechanics, evidentiary standards, and reform
  histories differ substantially across the Justiça Estadual,
  Federal, do Trabalho, and Eleitoral. Each has its own file.
- **Don't treat absence of a topic as a gap to fill.** Health-law
  detail, causation doctrine, and several other specialized topics
  are deliberately not in this directory because they're not
  cross-cutting enough. If a topic doesn't appear here, that's a
  signal — not an invitation to add it.
- **Don't refactor for the sake of refactoring.** The file structure
  has settled across multiple iterations; large reorganizations are
  high-cost and low-value.

## Repository setup

This repository is a standalone public reference, hosted at
<https://github.com/hsigstad/brazil-institutions-reference>. It is
designed to be used in two modes:

1. **Standalone**: clone and use directly.
2. **Nested into a research workspace**: clone into a working
   directory and add the path to the parent repo's `.gitignore`. The
   parent repo never touches the reference; edits commit and push to
   the public repo only. This is the recommended setup for working
   on related research without risk of cross-contamination.

## Style

- **Portuguese where translation loses meaning, English otherwise.**
  Many legal terms (*improbidade*, *parecer prévio*, *recurso
  especial*) have no clean English equivalent and stay in Portuguese.
- **Terse and citation-dense, not narrative.** Bullet points with
  inline citations are preferred over flowing prose.
- **Self-contained subsections.** A reader landing on a heading via
  grep should be able to understand the section without reading the
  whole file. Define key terms in context or link to `glossario.md`.
