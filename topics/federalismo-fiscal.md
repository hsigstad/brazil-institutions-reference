# Federalismo fiscal

Fiscal framework of Brazilian federalism: how tax revenue is assigned
across União / estados / municípios, the intergovernmental transfer
system (FPM, FPE, SUS, royalties), municipal taxation, and LRF limits.
Essential context for any empirical project that exploits
municipal-budget variation as a source of identification — or that
treats municipal fiscal capacity as an outcome.

**Snapshot as of 2026**: the FPM/FPE coefficient structure and the LRF
personnel-spending limits are stable (constitutional / LC level). What
moves year to year: annually indexed thresholds, FPM coefficient
re-classification based on IBGE population estimates, new royalty
distribution rules for oil/mining, and post-reforma tributária transition
arrangements (EC 132/2023 phase-in begins 2026 with full effect by 2033).

## 1. Constitutional tax assignment

The 1988 Constitution divides tax competences across three federative
levels (`CF.145`–`CF.162`). Each level has its own exclusive taxes,
plus a system of mandatory revenue sharing.

### União (federal) taxes

- **IR** (imposto de renda) — `CF.153.III`.
- **IPI** (imposto sobre produtos industrializados) — `CF.153.IV`.
- **IOF** (operações financeiras) — `CF.153.V`.
- **ITR** (territorial rural) — `CF.153.VI`.
- **Importação / Exportação** — `CF.153.I`, `CF.153.II`.
- **Contribuições sociais** (PIS, COFINS, CSLL, contribuição
  previdenciária) — `CF.195`, `CF.239`.

### Estado / DF taxes

- **ICMS** (circulação de mercadorias e serviços) — `CF.155.II`. **Largest
  single tax base in Brazil**; the state equivalent of a VAT.
- **IPVA** (veículos automotores) — `CF.155.III`.
- **ITCMD** (transmissão causa mortis e doação) — `CF.155.I`.

### Município taxes

- **IPTU** (propriedade predial e territorial urbana) — `CF.156.I`.
- **ISS** (serviços de qualquer natureza) — `CF.156.III`.
- **ITBI** (transmissão inter vivos de bens imóveis) — `CF.156.II`.

### Reforma tributária — `EC132-2023`

Promulgated December 2023. Replaces ICMS, ISS, IPI, PIS, COFINS with a
dual VAT:

- **CBS** (federal) — replaces PIS/COFINS.
- **IBS** (state + municipal) — replaces ICMS and ISS.
- **IS** ("imposto seletivo") — excise on goods harmful to health/environment.

Phase-in: 2026 pilot rates, full transition by 2033. Until transition
completes, the old tax system coexists with the new one. **For the bulk
of the project sample periods, the pre-`EC132-2023` system is the relevant one.**

## 2. Intergovernmental transfers — the transfer-dependent municipality

Most Brazilian municipalities depend overwhelmingly on transfers rather
than own-source revenue. Small municipalities typically raise <10% of
total revenue locally; the rest comes from FPM, ICMS quota-parte, SUS,
FUNDEB, and other constitutional transfers. This fiscal reality underpins most municipal-level research designs.

### FPM — Fundo de Participação dos Municípios

The largest constitutional transfer to municípios.

- **Source**: 22.5% of IR + IPI (`CF.159.I`), with additional
  shares added by `EC55-2007` (+1%, July), `EC84-2014` (+1%, December),
  `EC112-2021` (more in Sept), bringing total by ~2026 to ~25.5% of
  IR+IPI.
- **Distribution**: by coefficient based on population tiers (Decreto-Lei
  1.881/1981 + `LC62`). **Capital cities** get 10% of the total;
  **interior municipalities** get 86.4%; the remainder goes to a reserve
  for larger interior municipalities (Lei 5.172/1966 Art. 91).
- **Interior coefficient structure**: 16 population-tier brackets. Small
  towns cluster in lower brackets; the coefficient is a step function of
  population, not continuous.
- **This step function is a canonical RD instrument** in the Brazilian
  empirical literature (Litschig & Morrison; Brollo et al.; many others).
  Population crosses into a higher bracket → discrete jump in FPM per
  capita.
- **Population estimates**: IBGE releases annual estimates; FPM
  coefficients for year t are set by TCU based on IBGE estimate published
  by August of year t−1. Rule changes in 2013 (`LC143`) altered the
  reclassification mechanics.

**Source**: `LC62`; `LC143`; Decreto-Lei 1.881/1981.

### FPE — Fundo de Participação dos Estados

- **Source**: 21.5% of IR + IPI (`CF.159.I`).
- **Distribution**: originally fixed coefficients from `LC62` (declared
  unconstitutional by STF in ADI 875 et al., 2010, for perpetuating
  rigid shares). Replaced by **`LC143`**, which adopted a formula
  based on population and per-capita income, transitioning toward a
  more equalizing distribution.

### ICMS quota-parte (`CF.158.IV`)

- States must transfer **25% of ICMS collected** to their municipalities.
- Distribution rule (`CF.158.§unico`):
  - **At least 65%** proportional to the **value added** generated in
    the municipality (*valor adicionado fiscal*, VAF) — essentially
    commercial/industrial activity located there.
  - **Up to 35%** by state-defined criteria (typically population,
    environmental indicators, health/education outcomes).
- The VAF share creates strong incentives for municipalities to attract
  industrial activity and heavily shapes the geography of municipal
  finance.

### FUNDEB — Fundo de Manutenção e Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica

- Constitutional fund for basic education; states and municipalities
  contribute a share of specified taxes (20% of most state/municipal
  taxes); União tops up.
- Originally temporary (FUNDEF 1996, FUNDEB 2007) with sunset in 2020;
  made permanent by `EC108-2020`.
- Federal complementation grew under `EC108-2020` from 10% to 23% (phased).
- Distribution within each state is per-student-enrolled, weighted by
  education stage and modality.

**Source**: `CF.212-A` (post-`EC108-2020`); Lei 14.113/2020.

### SUS transfers

- **Constitutional minimum** (`CF.198.§2`, regulated by LC 141/2012):
  municipalities must spend **at least 15%** of own-source revenue on
  health; states **at least 12%**; União floor tied to nominal growth
  of receita corrente líquida (after `EC86-2015` and `EC95-2016`).
- **Fundo-a-fundo transfers**: Ministério da Saúde transfers directly to
  municipal health funds based on population and pactuated programs.
  Components (pre-2017): PAB fixo + PAB variável + MAC + assistência
  farmacêutica. Restructured in 2017 (Portaria GM/MS 3.992/2017) into
  just two blocks: **Custeio** and **Investimento**.
- Relevant to any municipal health-outcome research design.

### Royalties (oil, mining, water)

- **Pre-sal royalties**: Lei 12.858/2013 dedicates 75% of União's pre-sal
  royalty share to education and 25% to health. Distribution formula
  among states/municipalities has been repeatedly litigated and changed
  (Lei 12.734/2012 was partially suspended by STF).
- **Mining (CFEM)**: Compensação Financeira pela Exploração de Recursos
  Minerais; distributed to municipalities where extraction occurs (60%),
  states (15%), União (10%), and affected/transportation municipalities
  (15%). Lei 13.540/2017 revised rates and distribution.
- **Royalty windfalls** have been used as natural experiments for
  spending responses (Caselli & Michaels; Monteiro & Ferraz).

### Convênios and transferências voluntárias

- Non-constitutional discretionary transfers from União (ministries) or
  estados to municipalities via signed agreements.
- Historically tracked in **SICONV / Plataforma +Brasil** (post-2019).
  Relevant to political-alignment research (mayor-governor /
  mayor-president alignment effects).
- **Lei 13.019/2014** regulates convênios with civil society entities.

## 3. Municipal own-source revenue

Key own-source taxes:

- **IPTU**: property tax on urban real estate. Collection effort varies
  enormously across municipalities; many small municípios under-collect
  due to outdated cadastros and political costs of reassessment. IPTU is
  a classic outcome in studies of fiscal effort.
- **ISS**: tax on services. Rate set by municipal law within federal
  floor/ceiling (2%–5%). Large municipalities earn substantial ISS;
  small ones minimal.
- **ITBI**: transfer tax on real estate transactions.
- **Taxas e contribuições**: fees for specific services, improvement
  contributions, public lighting contribution (COSIP, `CF.149-A`).

### Fiscal effort vs. transfer dependence

Key stylized fact: municipalities that receive more in per-capita
transfers tend to exert **less** local fiscal effort. Analyzed extensively
in the Brazilian fiscal-federalism literature (Gadenne 2017 on Brazil
is the canonical empirical reference).

## 4. Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal (`LRF`)

Foundational statute disciplining the fiscal behavior of all three
government levels. See also `contas-municipais.md` §5 for how `LRF`
violations feed into the TCE parecer and câmara judgment of mayoral
accounts.

### Personnel spending limits (`LRF.19`–`LRF.20`)

Cap on **despesa total com pessoal** as a share of **receita corrente
líquida (RCL)**:

- **União**: 50% of RCL.
- **Estados**: 60% of RCL.
- **Municípios**: 60% of RCL, subdivided into:
  - **6%** for the câmara municipal (Legislativo);
  - **54%** for the Executivo.

**Alertas and sanctions**:
- **Limite de alerta** (90% of cap): TCE must warn.
- **Limite prudencial** (95% of cap): restrictions on new hiring, raises,
  overtime, contract creation.
- **Above 100%**: must be corrected within 2 quadrimestres (`LRF.23`);
  further non-compliance triggers transfer suspension, personal liability
  for the ordenador de despesas, and improbidade exposure.

### Debt limits (`LRF.29`–`LRF.30`)

- Senado Federal sets debt ceilings by resolution for all levels.
- **Resolução SF 40/2001**: debt consolidated líquido cap of **120% of
  RCL** for municípios, **200% of RCL** for estados.

### Budget discipline

- **LDO / LOA / PPA** hierarchy (`CF.165`): Plano Plurianual
  (4-year), Lei de Diretrizes Orçamentárias (annual guidelines), Lei
  Orçamentária Anual (annual budget).
- **Waiver of revenue** (*renúncia de receita*, `LRF.14`) requires
  compensating measures — constrains tax-break giveaways.
- **Geração de despesa obrigatória de caráter continuado** (`LRF.16`–`LRF.17`)
  requires impact estimate and compensation.
- **Fiscal targets** (*metas fiscais*) set in annex to the LDO.

### Last-year-of-mandate restriction (`LRF.42`)

- Outgoing mayors/governors cannot incur spending obligations in the
  last two quadrimestres of their term that cannot be paid before the
  end of their mandate, unless there is sufficient cash.
- Common cause of improbidade prosecution (ordenador passing "restos a
  pagar" beyond available cash to successor).

**Source**: `LRF`.

### Receita corrente líquida (RCL) — the denominator

- Defined in `LRF.2.IV`: sum of current revenue minus specified
  deductions (transfers to other federative levels, contribuições to
  social security, etc.), measured over the previous 12 months.
- The **relevant denominator** for all LRF percentage limits.
- Published by each federal entity on a bimonthly/quadrimestral basis in
  the Relatório Resumido de Execução Orçamentária (RREO) and Relatório
  de Gestão Fiscal (RGF).

---

## 5. Fiscal reporting and transparency

### Relatórios LRF

- **RREO** (Relatório Resumido de Execução Orçamentária): bimonthly;
  budgetary execution summary.
- **RGF** (Relatório de Gestão Fiscal): quadrimestral (annual for
  municipalities under 50k); fiscal limits compliance.
- Must be published electronically (LC 131/2009 — Lei da Transparência).

### SIOPS, SIOPE, FINBRA

- **SIOPS**: Sistema de Informações sobre Orçamentos Públicos em Saúde
  — standardized municipal health-spending reports. Primary source for
  any municipal-level health-spending research.
- **SIOPE**: analogous for education.
- **FINBRA** (Finanças do Brasil): STN's consolidated municipal fiscal
  database (now partially absorbed into **SICONFI** — Sistema de
  Informações Contábeis e Fiscais do Setor Público Brasileiro). Primary
  source for cross-municipal fiscal research.

**Source**: LC 131/2009.

## 6. Research design implications

- **FPM step function** → canonical RD for causal effects of municipal
  revenue (Litschig & Morrison; Brollo–Nannicini–Perotti–Tabellini on
  corruption).
- **ICMS VAF rule** → identification from industrial location shocks.
- **LRF personnel cap binding** → kink/threshold designs around the 60%
  limit.
- **Royalty windfalls** → time-varying instrument for spending.
- **Transfer vs. own-source composition** → drives political-economy
  research on accountability (Gadenne).

See also:
- `contas-municipais.md` — how LRF violations become TCE rejections and
  Ficha Limpa ineligibility.
- `tribunais-contas.md` — TCE audit of municipal accounts.
- `licitacoes.md` — procurement spending (the largest discretionary
  component of municipal budgets).
