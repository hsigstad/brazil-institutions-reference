## Lei 8.666/1993 — Lei Geral de Licitações

Governed virtually all Brazilian public procurement for nearly three decades.
Still the relevant statute for historical (pre-2021) analysis.

### Modalities (`L8666.22`)

Five modalities, each defined by value thresholds and procedural requirements:

- **Convite** (`L8666.23.I.a` / `L8666.23.II.a`): engineering up to
  R$150,000; goods/services up to R$80,000. Minimum 3 invited firms
  (`L8666.22.§3`).
- **Tomada de preços** (`L8666.23.I.b` / `L8666.23.II.b`): engineering
  up to R$1,500,000; goods/services up to R$650,000. Requires prior
  cadastro.
- **Concorrência**: above tomada de preços thresholds; open to all.
- **Concurso**: for technical/artistic/scientific work.
- **Leilão**: for sale of public goods.

Thresholds updated by Decreto 9.412/2018.

### Award criteria (`L8666.45`)

- **Menor preço** (lowest price) — default.
- Melhor técnica; técnica e preço; maior lance (for leilões).

### Publication requirements (`L8666.21`)

Diário Oficial, newspapers; varies by modality and value. Creates the paper
trail exploited in Audesp / TCE-SP datasets.

### Contract amendments (`L8666.65`)

Permitted up to **25% of original value** (50% for construction renovations,
`L8666.65.§1`). Frequent vehicle for ex-post price adjustments.

### Dispensa de licitação (`L8666.24`)

Enumerated exceptions where competitive bidding is not required:

- `L8666.24.I`: works/engineering below R$15,000 (original threshold).
- `L8666.24.II`: purchases/services below R$8,000 (original threshold).
- `L8666.24.IV`: emergency situations.
- `L8666.24.V`: no bidders appeared (*deserto*).

Dispensations and inexigibilidade are frequently cited in improbidade cases
as mechanisms for directing contracts without competition.

### Inexigibilidade (`L8666.25`)

When competition is objectively infeasible: sole source, artistic services,
specialized professionals.

### Anti-fracionamento rule (`L8666.23.§5`)

Prohibits splitting works or services of the same nature that could be
performed simultaneously or successively to circumvent modality thresholds.
`L14133.75.§1` strengthens this by requiring agencies to sum all
expenditures for objects of the same nature within a fiscal year.

### Criminal provisions (Arts. 89–98)

Crimes specific to procurement: fraud in bidding (`L8666` Art. 90),
unlawful dispensation (`L8666` Art. 89), obstruction of competition
(`L8666` Art. 95).

## Lei 10.520/2002 — Pregão

- Introduced the **pregão** modality: an open descending-price reverse auction.
- Initially for goods and standard services; expanded in practice.
- **Pregão eletrônico** mandatory for the federal government from Decreto
  10.024/2019; widely adopted by municipalities.
- Most common modality in municipal procurement during the 8.666 era.

**Source:** `LP`; Decreto 10.024/2019.

## `L14133` — Nova Lei de Licitações

- Replaces `L8666`, `LP` (Lei do Pregão), and the RDC (`RDC`).
- **Transition period:** municipalities could choose old or new regime until
  December 30, 2023 (`L14133.191`). After that date, `L14133` is mandatory.
- New modality: **diálogo competitivo** added.
- **Dispensa thresholds** (`L14133.75`): works/engineering up to R$100,000
  (`L14133.75.I`); goods/other services up to R$50,000 (`L14133.75.II`).
  Values updated annually via Decree. Significantly higher than L8666
  thresholds.
- Strengthened integrity requirements: compliance programs, risk matrices.

## CADE and cartel enforcement in procurement

### `LCADE` — Competition law

- Established **CADE** (Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica) as an
  autarquia with adjudicatory powers.
- **Cartel prohibition** (`LCADE.36`): agreements between competitors to
  fix prices, divide markets, or rig bids are administrative infractions.
- **Sanctions** (`LCADE.37`): fines of 0.1% to 20% of gross revenue.
- **Leniency program** (`LCADE.86`–`LCADE.87`): first confessor receives full or
  partial immunity; key source of information on cartel mechanics.

**Source:** `LCADE`.

### CADE typology of collusive strategies

From the CADE *Guia de Combate a Cartéis em Licitação* (December 2019, 58 pp),
Part II, Section II.3:

- **Cover bidding** (*propostas fictícias ou de cobertura*): competitors
  submit deliberately high bids to make the designated winner's bid appear
  competitive. Most common form of collusion in procurement.
- **Bid suppression / withdrawal** (*supressão/retirada de propostas*):
  firms refrain from bidding or withdraw bids to ensure the designated
  winner prevails.
- **Blocking in pregão presencial** (*bloqueio em pregão presencial*):
  cartel members submit bids within the 10% threshold of the lowest bid to
  block non-aligned firms from the verbal bidding phase. Does not apply to
  pregão eletrônico (footnote 36, p. 39).
- **Bid rotation** (*propostas rotativas / rodízio*): firms take turns
  winning across auctions or lots — by equal number of lots, market share,
  or production capacity.
- **Market division** (*divisão de mercado*): geographic or client-based
  allocation among cartel members. Often combined with cover bidding or
  bid suppression.
- **Other**: abuse of consórcios (`L8666.33`) and subcontracting
  to implement agreements and split cartel profits.

### Red flags for collusion

CADE guide Section II.4 (pp. 47–49) lists indicators at four stages:

- (I) **Bid submission**: few bids, unexplained withdrawals, bids with
  identical errors or formatting.
- (II) **Bidder declarations**: references to "industry prices".
- (III) **Bidder behavior**: winners subcontracting losers, periodic wins of
  similar quantities.
- (IV) **Outcomes**: rotation patterns, geographic concentration, disparate
  prices for similar objects.

### Intersection of cartel, fraud, and corruption

CADE guide Part IV (pp. 52–58):

- **Cartel** (agreement between competitors) and **fraud** (fake firms
  pretending to compete) are legally distinct but often coincide (p. 54).
- **Corruption** (public officials involved) and cartel can coexist and
  reinforce each other: officials may direct specifications or leak
  information to facilitate the cartel (p. 55).
- The same conduct can be prosecuted in parallel:
  - Administrative infraction by CADE (`LCADE.36`).
  - Criminal offense under `LCOT.4` and `L8666` Art. 90.
  - Improbidade administrativa by MP (`LIA`).
  - Corporate liability under `LAC.5`.
- Summary table on p. 58 maps sanctions, agreement types, and competent
  authorities across CADE, CGU, and MP/Police.

### Procurement as share of GDP

- OECD member countries: ~15% of GDP (CADE guide p. 12, citing OECD 2009).
- Brazil federal government (2018): 100,000+ procurement processes totaling
  ~R$48 billion (CADE guide p. 12, citing Painel de Compras).
- Cartel overpricing estimate: 10–20% (conservative; CADE guide p. 14; OECD).

### Notable CADE cases (from guide)

- **Cartel de Portas de Segurança Giratórias** (PA 08012.009611/2008-51):
  bid rotation + cover bidding, ~25% overpricing, 4 firms + 10 individuals
  convicted (2014). (p. 41)
- **Cartel em Licitação para Aquisição de Tintas** (PA 08012.006199/2009-07):
  blocking in pregão presencial, Prefeitura de Lages/SC, 3 firms convicted
  (2014). (p. 40)
- **Cartel do Transporte Aéreo Postal** (PA 08012.010362/2007-66):
  subcontracting to implement market division, ECT procurement, all
  investigated convicted (2014). (p. 46)
